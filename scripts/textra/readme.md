Miss Elizabeth,
Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter; by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those offers, which were last night so disgusting to you.
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by divelling on wishes, which for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention, your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwittingly, but I demand it of your justice.
```
